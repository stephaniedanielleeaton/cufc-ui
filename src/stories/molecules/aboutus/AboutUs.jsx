          <p className="font-light text-sm mb-4">
            Historical European Martial Arts, or HEMA for short, are martial arts from European countries that are no
            longer used in modern times.
          </p>
          <p className="font-light text-sm mb-4">
            Sometimes called historical fencing, HEMA involves fighting with weapons like:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li className="mb-2">Longsword</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Rapier</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Saber (sometimes spelled sabre)</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Dagger</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Arming sword and buckler (a small shield)</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Smallsword</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Staff</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="font-light text-sm mb-4">
            Unlike live-action roleplaying (LARP), HEMA is based on a handful of surviving fencing instruction manuals
            and manuscripts written in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance periods.
          </p>
          <p className="font-light text-sm">
            Our coaches have studied the works of German fencing masters Johannes Liechtenauer and Joachim Meyer and
            Italian master Fiore dei Liberi for over a decade and pass on the knowledge of centuries-old traditions in
            every class.

            <p className="font-light text-sm">
              While our lessons don't require members to study advanced techniques directly from the manuscripts, there's so much to learn.
              You'll learn the historical context and purpose of various weapons and how they were used, and then practice
              applying that information through sparring.
