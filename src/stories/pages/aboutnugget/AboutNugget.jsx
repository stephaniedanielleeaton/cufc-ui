              If you're new to the art of historical fencing, we encourage you to start with one of our four week fundamental
              classes. This class is designed for the complete beginner, and will teach you HEMA fundamentals through a single weapon style. 
              Over the course of 4 weeks, you'll receive instruction in basic footwork, form, and technique. These basics will prepare 
              you to join any of our weapon offerings after the starting course.

                Lender gear will be provided for you to participate in the whole
                session. Just wear comfortable gym clothing and bring a water bottle. Please note, that we only have
                fencing jackets up to size 2XL and some drills will be altered if we cannot provide a comfortable fitting jacket.

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                After the course is completed, you will still be able to borrow loaner gear. We find that most fencers
                purchase their own equipment at a rate that allows us to have gear available for every student that needs it. 
                However, priority for gear goes to the newest students.

              At the end of four weeks, you will be sparring ready. You will be invited to join the rest of our class
              offerings. Although the class will be focus on a singular weapon form, the basics you learn will allow you to join
              in any of our other class offerings.
